      This policy will identify AWS security groups which have rules which allow
      ingress from all IPv4 or IPv6 addresses via 0.0.0.0/0 or ::0/0 and remove
      the offending rules. The policy will then notify the impacted users. Per
      security best practices, security group rules should be limited to only
      the necessary IP CIDRs needed for communication and should not be open to
      everyone as this presents a large security risk to your infrastructure and
      may allow attackers to access your environment.
